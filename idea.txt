
### Core Features to Include
- User Registration: Allow participants to sign up, set up a profile (skills, interests, availability, previous experience), and add a short bio or portfolio.
- Intelligent Team Matching: Algorithmic recommendations based on skills, availability, or interests, allowing users to join teams or form new ones.
- Team Search & Join: Browse open teams, team up via invites, and see team requirements (number, skills needed, etc.).
- Skill Tags & Filtering: Tag users with skills (Python, AI/ML, frontend, design), filter for project fit.
- Messaging & Collaboration: Direct chat, group chats, and announcement features for seamless collaboration.
- Project Gallery: Showcase ongoing and finished hackathon projects for recruitment, networking, or inspiration.
- Notifications & Scheduling: Automated reminders for deadlines, hackathon registration, and team activity updates.
- Admin Panel: For moderators to manage users, events, and monitor activities.
- Optional: Voting, Certificates, and Judging Integration for extended event support.[3][4]

### Recommended Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js or Next.js (modern, fast UI, strong developer ecosystem)
- Tailwind CSS (for efficient, customizable, responsive styling)
- Optionally: TypeScript for type safety.[5][6]

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express (robust REST APIs, works seamlessly with JS frontends)
- Alternatively: Django (full-featured Python framework) or Flask (if you want minimal Python backend).[5]

**Database:**
- MongoDB (flexible, fast, easy to scale for user profiles, messages, and team data) or
- PostgreSQL (robust, relational, good for structured data)

**Authentication:**
- Firebase Auth, Auth0, or built-in via your backend (with JWT)

**DevOps:**
- GitHub Actions or CircleCI for CI/CD
- Vercel (works great for React/Next.js), Netlify, or Heroku for free/quick deployments.[5]

**Optional Integrations:**
- WebRTC or third-party for live video meets.
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase) for media uploads.
- AI/ML integration (matching algorithm), using TensorFlow.js or custom scikit-learn/ML models for smarter recommendations.[5]

### Example Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + Axios
- Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Heroku (backend)
- Other: SendGrid (email notifications), Socket.io (real-time messaging)


### Next Steps
- Finalize your name and domain
- Sketch initial feature flow/wireframe
- Recruit initial devs/designers
- Scaffold the frontend and backend repos with basic auth and landing page
- Iterate features (start with registration, team matching, and chat)
